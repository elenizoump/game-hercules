This is my first Project during the Web-Development Bootcamp and my first attempt of game design and implementation. My inspiration came from greek mythology and the achievements of the demigod Hercules. In this particular game I was recreating the challenge of Hercules winning against the stymphalian birds (man-eating birds).

The goal of the game is to avoid the stymphalian birds and increase the score by collecting the lightening bolts of Zeus. When the player loses all their lives they go to olympus to join Zeus and the other gods according to the original story.

For the making of this game I used html5, canvas, css and javascript. The characters were designed in Sketch.

I really enjoyed the process of making this game, from the conception of the theme to the programming and implementation of the sounds and design elements and I hope people will enjoy themselves playing this game as much as I did while creating it.
